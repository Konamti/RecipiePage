## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a new property I had difficulty understanding for time in CSS. I also learnt how insert attribution.

```css
td:nth-child(odd) {
  color: var(--Stone600);
}
td:nth-child(even) {
  color: var(--Brown800);
  font-weight: 600;
}

tr:last-child td {
  border-bottom: none;
}

ul li::marker {
  color: var(--Rose800);
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve my CSS responsive skills alot and flexbox properties. I would love to reinforce my knowledge on flexbox and other related properties.
